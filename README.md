This is raw step towards simplification of database and data operations with pure python.

Usage:

1. Invoke or run Python __main__.py
```shell
C:\User> python __main__.py
```
2. All the rest of the files will be imported automatically
3. For uploading data to server test, use the testServer.py as a simple server.

This project is now well fledged, and can now be run on the web as a data warehouse.
The functional programming design is no longer existing, and now it uses Object Oriented Programming Design.
It now has got a trial project for manipulating the data and can be found at:
