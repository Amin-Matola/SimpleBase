Database operations and queries from scratch with Python.
This is raw step towards simplification of database and data operations with pure python.

Usage:

1. Invoke or run Python __main__.py
2. All the rest of the files will be imported automatically
3. For uploading data to server test, use the testServer.py as a simple server.

Note: This project is welcoming changes from different support teams untill it gets its full-fledged developments.
And this project use functional programming because of how big the project code is
