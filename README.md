# SimpleBase
Database operations and queries from scratch with Python.

![Simple Base Image](http://learners.pythonanywhere.com/static/images/sBase.PNG)

This is raw step towards simplification of database and data operations with pure python.

Usage:

1. Invoke or run Python __main__.py
```shell
C:\User> python __main__.py
```
2. All the rest of the files will be imported automatically and a clear console will be presented to you.
3. For uploading data to server test, use the testServer.py as a simple server.

Note: This project is welcoming changes from different support teams untill it gets its full-fledged developments.
And this project use functional programming because of how big the project code is

                                UPDATE NOTICE                                      
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project is now well fledged, and can now be run on the web as a data warehouse.
The functional programming design is no longer existing, and now it uses Object Oriented Programming Design.
It now has got a trial project for manipulating the data and can be found at:

With the record tracker so far, you can do the following core activities:

1. [x] **Create** :pen: records on the go
- You can either create your records by filling the form or
- You can **Upload** a records file, e.g excel, json, txt or csv file

- You are not but free to manipulate the data in hand; the Tracker also allows you to merge your tables no matter how many you choose.
- Just click on **Merge** button, seen below the tables, and select the tables you want to merge, hence you are done.

This is the record tracker for the Simple Base project, the documentation for the core Command Program  and efficient usage can be found at:
